                            p
                                | We concentrate in developing software for several industries:
                            ul
                                li Banking

                            p
                                | We also play the role as your strategic technology provider enabling the design and development of secure, scalable and flexible web-based applications. The methodology we follow during the software development life cycle ensures active client involvement at every step of the process.
                            p
                                | The six core process workflows for software development and delivery are as follows:
                            p
                                | 1) Business Modeling document business processes using business use cases. The business use cases are analyzed to understand how the business should support the business processes. This is documented in a business object model. This step is optional for some projects.
                                | Requirements describe what the system should do and allow the developers and the client to agree on that description. To achieve this we elicit, organize and document the required functionality and constraints. A vision document is created and stakeholder needs are elicited. Use cases are identified to represent the behavior of the system. The use cases function as a unifying thread throughout the system’s development cycle. The same use case model is used during requirements capture, analysis & design and testing. The deliverable at the end of this phase is the Functional Requirements Specifications document.
                            p
                                | 2) Analysis & Design determine how the system will be realized in the implementation phase. Analysis & Design results in a design model. The design model serves as an abstraction of the source code. The design model consists of design classes and design subsystems with well-defined interfaces, representing what will become components in the implementation. The deliverable at the end of this phase is the System Requirements Specification document.
                            p
                                | 3) Implementation the system is realized through the implementation of components. The purpose of this workflow is:
                            ul
                                li To define the organization of code, in terms of implementation subsystems
                                li To implement objects and classes in terms of subsystems
                                li To test the developed components as units
                                li
                                    | To integrate the results produced by individual implementers (or teams) into an executable system.
                            p
                                | 4) Test - the purpose of this workflow is:
                            ul
                                li To verify the integration between components
                                li To verify the proper integration of all components
                                li To verify that all requirements have been correctly implemented
                                li
                                    | To identify and ensure defects are addressed prior to the deployment of the software
                            p
                                | Testing is an iterative process, which means that testing is performed throughout the project. Tests are carried out along three quality dimensions – reliability, functionality, application performance and system performance. The deliverable at the end of this phase is testing documentation for the test procedures implemented.
                            p
                                | 5) Deployment successfully deliver the project to the end user. Main activities include:
                            ul
                                li Installation
                                li Support
                                li Planning and conducting beta tests
                                li Formal acceptance
                            p
                                | Typically, the deliverables at the end of deployment include application source code, user manuals and support documentation.
                            p
                                | 6) Cultural Collaboration
