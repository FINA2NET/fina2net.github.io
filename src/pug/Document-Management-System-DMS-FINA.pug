                                p.text-justify DMS resolves paperwork at its birth place. Of course paperwork is needed because business processes need to be recorded: documents must be created, approvals must be filled by multiple employees and workflow of business processes must be gone through several rooms. Document management systems can integrate all business processes, filling forms workflows and approvals. As a result all the documents, approvals, scanned files and reports are placed in DMS and this information is sharable, and can be collaborated with other users. The most important thing is that documents over time accumulate a big amount of information and this information needs to be retrieved. Because of the fact that all the information, business processes, forms, documents, recipients and approvals are already in digital form, Reports can be made with one click of a button. This makes information reachable and easy to analyse.
